          Facebook requires that UsersDelight  notify you and require you to agree to all of the following terms and conditions in connection with your use of the Facebook platform:<br><br>



          <b>I. Introduction</b><br><br>

          The terms and conditions below describe the terms applicable to your installation and use of certain applications which use the Facebook Platform (as defined below) to access certain information about you that is available from the www.facebook.com website (the "Facebook Site") or to retrieve authorized data from third-party sites for use on the Facebook Site ("Platform Applications").
          <br><br>

          The "Facebook Platform" is a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) and services provided by Facebook which makes this information available to Platform Applications and allows Facebook and third-party developers ("Developers") to develop new features and applications that we hope will enhance your ability to interact with people in your life in new and interesting ways.
          <br><br>

          PLEASE NOTE: The Facebook Platform does not give Developers access to your e-mail address, personal website, instant messenger ID, telephone number or street address ("Contact Information"). Facebook will only disclose your Contact Information to third parties in accordance with the Facebook Privacy Policy.
          <br><br>



          <b>II. Consent Regarding Use of Facebook Site Information</b><br><br>



          Information That May Be Provided to Developers. In order to allow you to use and participate in Platform Applications created by Developers ("Developer Applications"), Facebook may from time to time provide Developers access to the following information (collectively, the "Facebook Site Information"):
          <br><br>



          (a) any information provided by you and visible to you on the Facebook Site, excluding any of your Contact Information, and
          <br><br>

          (b) the user ID associated with your Facebook Site profile.
          <br><br>



          (c) Examples of Facebook Site Information. The Facebook Site Information may include, without limitation, the following information, to the extent visible on the Facebook Site: your name, your profile picture, your gender, your birthday, your hometown location (city/state/country), your current location (city/state/country), your political view, your activities, your interests, your musical preferences, television shows in which you are interested, movies in which you are interested, books in which you are interested, your favorite quotes, the text of your "About Me" section, your relationship status, your dating interests, your relationship interests, your summer plans, your Facebook user network affiliations, your education history, your work history, your course information, copies of photos in your Facebook Site photo albums, metadata associated with your Facebook Site photo albums (e.g., time of upload, album name, comments on your photos, etc.), the total number of messages sent and/or received by you, the total number of unread messages in your Facebook in-box, the total number of "pokes" you have sent and/or received, the total number of wall posts on your Wall, a list of user IDs mapped to your Facebook friends, your social timeline, and events associated with your Facebook profile.
          <br><br>



          (d) Privacy Settings: You may revoke or modify your permission for Facebook to provide Facebook Site Information to Developers at any time through the means provided in your privacy settings.
          <br><br>

          (e) Developer Agreement. Before providing any information to any Developer through the Facebook Platform, Facebook requires each Developer to enter into an agreement (a "Developer Agreement"), which, among other things, strictly limits their collection, use, and storage of Facebook Site Information. Our standard Developer Agreement consists of the Facebook Developer Terms and Conditions and the related Facebook Platform Application Guidelines. We may from time to time enter into separate agreements with certain third party Developers that contain different or additional terms, provided however, that each such separate agreement will require the third party Developer to only display your information in accordance with your Facebook privacy settings. The standard Developer Agreement is subject to change without prior notice at any time, in the Company's sole discretion, so you should review these terms from time to time. However, Facebook cannot guarantee that each Developer will comply with its contractual requirements, and Facebook does not assume any liability or responsibility for any of Developer's actions, Developer Applications or websites, or for enforcing any Developer Agreement against any Developer.
          <br><br>



          (f) Facebook Applications. Platform Applications developed by Facebook ("Facebook Applications") may also make use of Facebook Site Information. Facebook will use and disclose Facebook Site Information in connection with Facebook Applications only in accordance with the Facebook Privacy Policy.
          <br><br>



          <b>III. Use of Platform Applications</b><br><br>

          (a) Developer Applications. When you install a Developer Application, you understand that such Developer Application has not been approved, endorsed, or reviewed in any manner by Facebook, and we are not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Developer Applications, including without limitation the content, accuracy, or reliability of such Developer Application and the privacy practices or other policies of the Developer. YOU USE SUCH DEVELOPER APPLICATIONS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Developers may require you to agree to their own terms of service, privacy policies and/or other policies as a condition of using Developer Applications. Those terms and/or policies may give Developers rights with respect to your Facebook Site Information beyond those provided by the Developer Agreement.

          <br><br>
          (c) You acknowledge that Developers or Facebook or its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to any and all Platform Applications, portions thereof, and/or content or software provided through or in conjunction with any Platform Applications, including without limitation any and all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other proprietary rights, and any and all applications, renewals, extensions and restorations thereof, now or hereafter in force and effect worldwide.

          (f) Integration or "Entire Agreement" Clauses in Application-Specific Terms and Conditions. For the avoidance of doubt, the existence of any provision of any separate terms and conditions or agreements applicable to any Facebook Applications to the effect that such terms or agreement constitute the entire agreement or understanding between you and Facebook with respect to any subject matter, however phrased, will not be deemed to supersede or preclude enforcement of any of the terms and conditions set forth in paragraphs III (c), (d) (e) and (g) and this paragraph (f), , except to the extent that such terms directly conflict with the terms of such other agreement or terms.
          <br><br>

          <br><br>
          (h) Modifications. Facebook reserves the right to modify these Platform Application Terms of Use at any time, in its sole discretion. If Facebook elects to modify this Agreement, Facebook will post a change notice or a new agreement on the Facebook Site. IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO REVOKE YOUR PERMISSION FOR FACEBOOK TO PROVIDE FACEBOOK SITE INFORMATION TO DEVELOPERS AS DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (h) ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT REVOKE SUCH PERMISSION PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE
          DATE OF ANY CHANGE NOTICE OR NEW AGREEMENT POSTED ON OUR SITE, YOU WILL BE CONCLUSIVELY DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHANGE.

          <br/><br/>
          F. SPECIAL CLAUSE<br/>
          If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept
the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms
and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the
absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Nevada (excluding choice of law).
